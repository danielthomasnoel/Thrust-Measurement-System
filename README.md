The Thrust Measurement Device (TMD) was conceived to collect reliable propeller performance data in a pedagogical environment. An iterative design review process brought the thrust measurement device from an idea to a product. It applies mechatronic principles to the exploration and quantification of basic fluid dynamics properties, providing a way for the user to accurately measure the thrust generated by a propeller at a variable angular velocity. The TMD is driven by an Arduino microcontroller that collects data from a load cell and an inferred sensor to calculate the thrust and RPM of an attached propellor. LCD screens display both the thrust and RPMs in real time. The propellorâ€™s angular velocity is determined by a potentiometer that limits the power supplied to a DC motor, allowing the user to adjust the rate at which the propellor is turning. This data is recorded and stored on an onboard SD card for further analysis. To maximize the audience and application of the TMD, its construction is designed to be repeatable exportable to other educators.
